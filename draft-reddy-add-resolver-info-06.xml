    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a method for DNS resolvers to publish
      information about themselves. Clients can use the resolver information
      to identify the capabilities of DNS resolvers.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Historically, DNS stub resolvers communicated with recursive
      resolvers without needing to know anything about the features supported
      by these recursive resolvers. As more and more recursive resolvers
      expose different features that may impact the delivered DNS service,
      means to help stub resolvers to identify the capabilities of the
      resolver are valuable. Typically, stub resolvers can discover and
      authenticate encrypted DNS servers provided by a local network, for
      example, using the techniques specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref>. However, these stub resolvers need a
      means to retrieve information from the discovered recursive resolvers
      about their capabilities.</t>

      <t>This document fills that void by specifying a method for stub
      resolvers to retrieve such information. To that aim, a new RRtype is
      defined for stub resolvers to query the recursive resolvers. The
      information that a resolver might want to give is defined in <xref
      target="attributes"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Retrieved information can be used to feed the server selection
      procedure.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC8499"></xref>.</t>

      <t>'Encrypted DNS' refers to a DNS protocol that provides an encrypted
      channel between a DNS client and server (e.g., DoT, DoH, or DoQ).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="resolver-info" title="Retrieving Resolver Information">
      <t>A stub resolver that wants to retrieve the resolver information may
      use the RRtype "RESINFO" defined in this document (see <xref
      target="RESINFO"></xref>).</t>

      <t>The content of the RDATA in a response to RRtype query is defined in
      <xref target="attributes"></xref>. If the resolver understands the
      RESINFO RRtype, the RRset in the Answer section MUST have exactly one
      record.</t>

      <t>The client can retrieve the resolver information using the RESINFO
      RRtype and QNAME of the domain name that is used to authenticate the DNS
      server (referred to as ADN in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref>).</t>

      <t>If the special use domain name "resolver.arpa" defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref> is used to discover the Encrypted DNS
      server, the client can retrieve the resolver information using the
      RESINFO RRtype and QNAME of the designated resolver.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="content-format"
             title="Format of the Resolver Information">
      <t>DNS TXT records are used to store key/value pairs conveying the
      resolver information. The intention of using TXT records is to convey a
      small amount of useful information about a resolver. The general format
      rules for DNS TXT records are discussed in Section 6.1 of <xref
      target="RFC6763"></xref> and the recommendations to limit the TXT record
      size are discussed in Section 6.2 of <xref target="RFC6763"></xref>.
      Each key/value pair is encoded using the format rules in Section 6.3 of
      DNS-SD <xref target="RFC6763"></xref>. Using standardized key/value
      syntax within the TXT record makes it easier for additional keys to be
      defined later. If an implementation sees unknown keys in a resolver TXT
      record, it MUST silently ignore them. The rules for the keys is defined
      in Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC6763"></xref>.</t>

      <t>All keys MUST either be defined in the IANA registry <xref
      target="resolver-information"></xref> or begin with the substring
      "temp-" for names defined for local use only.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="attributes" title="Resolver Information">
      <t>The resolver information includes the following keys and values:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="qnameminimization:">If the DNS server supports QNAME
          minimisation <xref target="RFC9156"></xref> to improve DNS privacy,
          the key is present. Note that, as per the rules for the keys is
          defined in Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC6763"></xref>, if there
          is no '=' in a resolver TXT record string, then it is a boolean
          attribute, simply identified as being present, with no value. This
          is a mandatory attribute.</t>

          <t hangText="extendeddnserror:">If the DNS server supports extended
          DNS error (EDE) <xref target="RFC8914"></xref> to return additional
          information about the cause of DNS errors, the parameter lists the
          possible extended DNS error codes that can be returned by the DNS
          server. This is an optional attribute.</t>

          <t hangText="resinfourl:">An URL that points to the generic
          unstructured resolver information (e.g., DoH APIs supported,
          possible HTTP status codes returned by the DoH server, how to report
          a problem) for troubleshooting purpose. The server MUST support the
          content-type 'text/html'. The DNS client MUST reject the URL if the
          scheme is not "https". The client MUST validate that both the
          encrypted DNS server and the resolver information server are owned
          and managed by the same entity by establishing a TLS connection to
          the domain name in the URL and checking if the subjectAltName entry
          in the server certificate includes the name of the encrypted DNS
          server. If this match fails, the client MUST ignore the resolver
          information. As such, the URL should be treated only as diagnostic
          information for IT staff. This is a mandatory attribute.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>New keys can be defined as per the procedure defined in <xref
      target="resolver-information"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Unless a DNS request to retrieve the resolver information is
      encrypted (e.g., sent over DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref> or DNS-over- HTTPS (DoH)) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref>, the response is susceptible to forgery. The
      DNS resolver information can be retrieved after the encrypted connection
      is established to the DNS server or retrieved before the encrypted
      connection is established to the DNS server by using local DNSSEC
      validation.</t>
