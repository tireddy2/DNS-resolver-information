1.  Introduction

   Historically, DNS stub resolvers communicated with recursive
   resolvers without needing to know anything about the features
   supported by these recursive resolvers.  As more and more recursive
   resolvers expose different features that may impact the delivered DNS
   service, means to help stub resolvers to identify the capabilities of
   the resolver are valuable.  Typically, stub resolvers can discover
   and authenticate encrypted DNS servers provided by a local network,
   for example, using the techniques specified in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and
   [I-D.ietf-add-ddr].  However, these stub resolvers need a means to
   retrieve information from the discovered recursive resolvers about
   their capabilities.

   This document fills that void by specifying a method for stub
   resolvers to retrieve such information.  To that aim, a new RRtype is
   defined for stub resolvers to query the recursive resolvers.  The
   information that a resolver might want to give is defined in
   Section 5.

   Retrieved information can be used to feed the server selection
   procedure.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft          DNS Resolver Information             August 2022


   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].

   'Encrypted DNS' refers to a DNS protocol that provides an encrypted
   channel between a DNS client and server (e.g., DoT, DoH, or DoQ).

3.  Retrieving Resolver Information

   A stub resolver that wants to retrieve the resolver information may
   use the RRtype "RESINFO" defined in this document (see Section 7.1).

   The content of the RDATA in a response to RRtype query is defined in
   Section 5.  If the resolver understands the RESINFO RRtype, the RRset
   in the Answer section MUST have exactly one record.

   The client can retrieve the resolver information using the RESINFO
   RRtype and QNAME of the domain name that is used to authenticate the
   DNS server (referred to as ADN in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr]).

   If the special use domain name "resolver.arpa" defined in
   [I-D.ietf-add-ddr] is used to discover the Encrypted DNS server, the
   client can retrieve the resolver information using the RESINFO RRtype
   and QNAME of the designated resolver.

4.  Format of the Resolver Information

   The resolver information uses the same format as DNS TXT records.
   The intention of using the same format as TXT records is to convey a
   small amount of useful information about a resolver.  The format
   rules for TXT records are defined in Section 3.3.14 of the DNS
   specification [RFC1035] and Section 6.1 of the DNS-based Service
   Discovery [RFC6763].  The recommendations to limit the TXT record
   size are discussed in Section 6.2 of [RFC6763].  The RESINFO RRtype
   uses key/value pairs to convey the resolver information.  Each key/
   value pair is encoded using the format rules defined in Section 6.3
   of DNS-SD [RFC6763].  Using standardized key/value syntax within the
   RESINFO RRtype makes it easier for additional keys to be defined
   later.  If an implementation sees unknown keys in a RESINFO RRtype,
   it MUST silently ignore them.  The rules for the keys is defined in
   Section 6.4 of [RFC6763].

   Keys MUST either be defined in the IANA registry Section 7.2 or
   begin with the substring "temp-" for names defined for local use
   only.

5.  Resolver Information

   The resolver information includes the following keys and values:

Internet-Draft          DNS Resolver Information             August 2022


   qnamemin:  If the DNS server supports QNAME minimisation [RFC9156] to
      improve DNS privacy, the key is present.  Note that, as per the
      rules for the keys is defined in Section 6.4 of [RFC6763], if
      there is no '=' in a key, then it is a boolean attribute, simply
      identified as being present, with no value.  This is a mandatory
      attribute.

   exterr:  If the DNS server supports extended DNS error (EDE)
      [RFC8914] to return additional information about the cause of DNS
      errors, the parameter lists the possible extended DNS error codes
      that can be returned by the DNS server.  When multiple values are
      present, these values MUST be comma-separated.  This is an optional
      attribute.

   infourl:  An URL that points to the generic unstructured resolver
      information (e.g., DoH APIs supported, possible HTTP status codes
      returned by the DoH server, how to report a problem) for
      troubleshooting purpose.  The server MUST support the content-type
      'text/html'.  The DNS client MUST reject the URL if the scheme is
      not "https".  The client MUST validate that both the encrypted DNS
      server and the resolver information server are owned and managed
      by the same entity by establishing a TLS connection to the domain
      name in the URL and checking if the subjectAltName entry in the
      server certificate includes the name of the encrypted DNS server.
      If this match fails, the client MUST ignore the resolver
      information.  As such, the URL should be treated only as
      diagnostic information for IT staff.  This is a mandatory
      attribute.

   New keys can be defined as per the procedure defined in Section 7.2.

   Figure 1 shows an example of resolver information.

             Figure 1: An Example of Resolver Information Record

6.  Security Considerations

   Unless a DNS request to retrieve the resolver information is
   encrypted (e.g., sent over DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] or DNS-over-
   HTTPS (DoH)) [RFC8484], the response is susceptible to forgery.  The
   DNS resolver information can be retrieved after the encrypted
   connection is established to the DNS server or retrieved before the
   encrypted connection is established to the DNS server by using local
   DNSSEC validation.

7.  IANA Considerations

      Note to the RFC Editor: Please update [RFCXXXX] with the RFC
      number to be assigned to this document.

7.1.  RESINFO RRtype

   This document requests IANA to register a new value from the
   "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" subregistry of the "Domain Name System
   (DNS) Parameters" registry available at [RRTYPE]:

   Type: RESINFO
   Value: TBD
   Meaning: Resolver Information as Key/Value Pairs
   Reference: [RFCXXXX]

7.2.  DNS Resolver Information Registration

   This document requests IANA to create a new registry entitled "DNS
   Resolver Information".  This registry contains definitions of the
   names that can be used to provide the resolver information.

   The registration procedure is Specification Required (Section 4.6 of
   [RFC8126]).

   The structure of the registry is as follows:

   Name:  The name to be used in the key.  The name MUST conform to the
      definition in Section 6.4 of [RFC6763].  The IANA registry MUST
      NOT register names that begin with "temp-", so these names can be
      used freely by any implementer.

   Value Type:  The type of value to be used in the key.

   Description:  Provides a description of the attribute

   Specification:  The reference specification for the registered
      element.

   The initial content of this registry is provided in Table 1.
